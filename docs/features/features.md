## Full integration with Gramps Desktop

Gramps Web uses the same **Model / Database** structure that [Gramps Desktop](https://gramps-project.org/) uses for storing genalogical data.  You can browse all the same [Record Types](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_Data_Model) you do in Gramps Desktops: ***people, families, events, places, repositories, sources, citations, media objects, and notes.***

Using the [Gramps Web Sync Add-on](administration/sync.md) for Gramps Desktop, data can be synchronized bi-directionally between Gramps Web and Gramps Desktop! Go ahead and edit your data with Gramps Web or the Gramps Desktop App which you know and love - they work together seamlessly!

## Privacy Levels / User Access

Many folks want to keep some details private and we respect that!  You can mark Records as Private and control which users are allowed to view private records. Private records are filtered out at the database layer for maximum security.  In addition, you can control what users are able to add and edit.
