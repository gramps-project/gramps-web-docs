 <!-- 
by using HTML below, we can set these image display to 'none' so the image do not show; however, they will show if 
the user clicks the first image above and goes into 'glightbox' mode.  Users can then 'scroll' through the various
GrampsWeb UI images.  Those who don't notice the 'next' arrow in glightbox and only view the one image displayed, 
then no harm, no foul, behavior is as expected; however, for others who do notice the 'right arrow' button in 
glightbox, then they can view additional images if they like.  win-win
