# Gramps Web Administrator's Guide

Whether you have set up your own instance of Gramps Web or signed up for a pre-installed one, the next step is to populate and manage your family tree database.

The focus of this section is on administrative tasks performed by **tree owners**. Usually, there is one tree owner for each family tree database (although as tree owner, you can also create other tree owner accounts).

This section only deals with actions that can be performed from the web interface. For command line tools or server configuration, see the previous section [Setup](../install_setup/setup.md).
