# Gramps Web backend development

The backend of Gramps Web is called [Gramps Web API](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps-webapi/). In fact it is more than just an app backend: it provides a RESTful API to read and modify a Gramps database.

Gramps Web API is a Python application and is powered by the `gramps` library itself (which also powers the Gramps Desktop application).

In this section of the docs, you can learn how to contribute to Gramps Web API development.
