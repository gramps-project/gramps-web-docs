## Reporting issues

If you encounter a problem that you believe is a bug in Gramps Web, please support it via Github.

There are two separate Github repositories for the code used in Gramps Web, one for the user interface (&ldquo;frontend&rdquo;) and one for the server code (&ldquo;backend&rdquo;):

- [Frontend issues](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps-web/issues)
- [Backend issues](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps-web-api/issues)


If you are unsure where to file an issue, don't worry and just choose either of the two &ndash; the maintainers will be able to transfer the issue if necessary.

In either case, please always include the following information in your report:

- Details about your setup (e.g. a docker-compose file with sensitive values redacted, or whether your are using a hosted version, such as Grampshub, or a pre-configured image, such as DigitalOcean)
- Version information. To obtain it, go to the "System information" tab on the Settings page in Gramps Web and copy/paste the values in the box, which should look something like this:

```
Gramps 5.1.6
Gramps Web API 1.5.1
Gramps.js 24.1.0
locale: en
multi-tree: false
task queue: true
```
