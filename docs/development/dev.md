# Gramps Web development: overview

Gramps Web is a web application that consists of two components that are developed separately:

- **Gramps Web API** is a RESTful API written in Python and based on Flask. The source code is hosted at [github.com/gramps-project/gramps-web-api](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps-web-api/). It manages database access and genealogical functions directly leveraging the Gramps Python library. It serves as the backend of Gramps Web. For development documentation, see [Backend](dev-backend/index.md).
- **Gramps Web Frontend** is a Javascript web application that serves as the frontend to Gramps Web. The source code is hosted at [github.com/gramps-project/gramps-web](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps-web/). For development documentation, see [Frontend](dev-frontend/index.md).

A note on versioning: Gramps Web API and and the Gramps Web frontend are versioned independently. At present, "Gramps Web" &ndash; the combined application &ndash; does not have a separate version number. Both projects adhere to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
