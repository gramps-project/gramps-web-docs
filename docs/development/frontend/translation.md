Gramps Web leverages the translations of Gramps Desktop provided by the community for over 40 languages. The additional strings that only needed for the Web app are translated via Weblate.

To contribute, follow [the instructions in the Gramps Wiki](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Translating_Gramps_using_Weblate) to get started with Weblate for Gramps. Once authenticated, you can start translating strings both for Gramps Desktop and Gramps Web.
